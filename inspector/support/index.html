      <h2>How to detect link issues in a PDF</h2>
      <a name="linkissues"></a>
      <h3>To detect and/or fix issues with internal links:</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>Click on Tools &gt; Issues &gt; Links</li>
	<li>Verify that the presented issues (if any) are correct</li>
	<li>Click on "Resolve Issues" (if any) to resolve the issues</li>
      </ol>
      Note that issues are sometimes <em>stacking</em>, which means PDF Inspector will sometimes give a new set of issues and ask you whether to fix them as well. This may happen more than once.

      <h3>To detect issues with external links</h3>
      <ol>
	<li>Click on Tools &gt; Issues &gt; External Links</li>
	<li>A progress bar appears and, depending on how many links there are in the PDF, may take a while to complete.</li>
	<li>A window with information about problems encountered, if any, appears. At the top of the window is a summary, indicating total number of URLs, how many URLs were okay, okay (with irregular status codes), and/or gave errors (such as a 404 error).</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

      </ol>

      <ol>
	<li>Select the link by clicking on it (if you don't see a colored rectangle around the link, you may need to enable <em>Highlight Links</em>)</li>

	<li>Click on the property you wish to edit (you may need to double click). Note that you cannot change certain properties, such as Source page or Object ID.</li>
